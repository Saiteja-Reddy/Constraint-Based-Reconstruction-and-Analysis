## Constraint Based Reconstruction and Analysis

The main aim of this independent study would be to understand the basics of genome-scale network reconstruction which represents the structured integration of all available information about the target organism. The focus would be on mathematical methods that have been developed to interrogate the properties of reconstructed networks mainly for constraint based analysis. This would also include implementing the above mathematical methods by setting up and utilizing the COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) Toolbox available in MATLAB.
