# Independent Study
## Constraint Based Reconstruction and Analysis
### Monsoon 2018
### Guide: Dr. Vinod Palakkad

The main aim of this independent study would be to understand the basics of genome-scale network reconstruction which represents the structured integration of all available information about the target organism. The focus would be on mathematical methods that have been developed to interrogate the properties of reconstructed networks mainly for constraint based analysis. This would also include implementing the above mathematical methods by setting up and utilizing the COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) Toolbox available in MATLAB.

### Topics Covered
1. Basics of Network Reconstruction
2. Process of Network Reconstruction for different types of networks
  - Metabolic Networks
  - Signalling Networks
  - Biochemical Reaction Networks
3. Mathematical Properties of Reconstructed Networks
  - The Stoichiometric Matrix
  - Network Topological Properties
  - Pathways
4. Constraints
  - Stating and Imposing Constraints to networks
  - Various Types of Constraints, their representations and analysis
  - Constraint-based modelling
  - Process of Reconstruction of GEMs
5. Optimization
  - Overview of Constraint-based Methods
  - Introduction to the Constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) methods
  - Integration of Omics Data into the constraints
  - Formulating Objective Functions
6. Understanding from metabolic networks perspective using the COBRA Toolbox.

### Outcome:
  - Understand the above topics with required mathematical formulations.
  - Setup and get comfortable working with COBRA Toolbox.
  - Exposure to recent developments in Constraint Based Optimization.
