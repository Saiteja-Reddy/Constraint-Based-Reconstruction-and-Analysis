### Methods for Analysis of Constraint-Based Reconstructions of Metabolic Networks

There are numerous methods that have been developed to analyze constraint-based reconstructions of metabolic networks using experimental data to answer biological questions. Below is a list of some of these methods and questions they can help to answer.

| Method 	| Question 	|
|----------------------------------------------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Equivalent Optima 	| How many flux states can be attained by maximizing or minimizing an objective function (e.g., maximum growth or ATP production)? 	|
| Energy Balance Analysis 	| How can one evaluate the thermodynamic feasibility of FBA simulation results? 	|
| ExPa/ElMo 	| How does one define a biochemically feasible, unique set of reactions that span the steady-state solution space? 	|
| FBA 	| What is the maximum (or minimum) of a specified cellular objective function? 	|
| Flux Confidence Interval 	| What are the confidence intervals of flux values when fluxomic data are mapped to a constraint-based model? 	|
| Flux Coupling 	| What are the sets of network reactions that are fully coupled, partially coupled, or directionally coupled? 	|
| Flux Variability Analysis 	| What is the maximum and minimum flux for every reaction under a given set of constraints (i.e., what is the bounding box of the solution space)? 	|
| Gap-Fill/Gap-Find 	| What are the candidate reactions that can fill network gaps, thus helping improve the model and provide hypotheses for unknown pathways that can be validated experimentally? 	|
| Gene Annotation 	| Which reactions are likely missing from the network, 	|
| Refinement Algorithm 	| given a set of phenotypic observations? What are the candidate gene products with which corresponding reactions could fill the gap? 	|

| Metabolite Essentiality 	| How does metabolite essentiality contribute to cellular robustness? 	|
| Minimization of Metabolic Adjustment (MOMA) 	| Can suboptimal growth predictions be more consistent with experimental data in wild-type and knock-out strains? 	|
| Net Analysis 	| Given metabolomic data, what are the allowable metabolite concentration ranges for other metabolites, and what are likely regulated steps in the pathway based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics? 	|
| Objective function finder/ObjFind 	| Which are different possible cellular objectives? 	|
| Optimal Metabolic Network Identification 	| Given experimentally measured flux data, what is the most likely set of active reactions in the network under the given condition that will reconcile data with model predictions? 	|
| OptKnock/OptGene OptReg 	| How can one design a knock-out strain that is optimized for by-product secretion coupled to biomass production? 	|
| OptReg 	| What are the optimal reaction activations/inhibitions and eliminations to improve biochemical production? 	|
| OptStrain 	| Which reactions (not encoded by the genome) need to be added in order to enable a strain to produce a foreign compound? 	|
| PhPP 	| How does an objective function change as a function of two metabolite exchanges? 	|
| rFBA 	| How do transcriptional regulatory rules affect the range of feasible in silico phenotypes? 	|
| Regulatory On/Off Minimization 	| After a gene knock-out, what is the most probable flux distribution that requires a minimal change in transcriptional regulation? 	|
| Robustness analysis 	| How does an objective function change as a function of another network flux? 	|
| SR-FBA 	| To what extent do different levels of metabolic and transcriptional regulatory constraints determine metabolic behavior? 	|
| Stable Isotope Tracers 	| How can intracellular flux predictions be validated experimentally, and which pathways are active under the different conditions? 	|
| Thermodynamics-based Metabolic Flux Analysis 	| How can one use thermodynamic data to generate thermodynamically feasible flux profiles? 	|
| Uniform Random Sampling 	| What are the distributions of network states that have not been excluded based on physico-chemical constraints and/or experimental measurements? What are the completely or partially correlated reaction sets? 	|
